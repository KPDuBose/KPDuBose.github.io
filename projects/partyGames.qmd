# partyGames

The partyGames package was written to simulate different games under a variaty of condidtions. 

Currently, the package simulates:

- White Elephant Gift Exchanges
- Monopoly

Further information about the package, including installation instructions, can be found [here](https://github.com/KPDuBose/partyGames).

Brief information about functionality follows.

# White Elephant Games

The following shows how to simulate a white elephant gift game utalizing a 6-sided die and a fair coin.

```{r example-monopoly}
library(partyGames)
games <- simulateElephant(15, dice = TRUE, coins = 1, iter = 1500, pheads = 0.5, sides = 6, numDice = 1)
summary.partyGames(games)
class(games)
plot.partyGames(games)
plot.partyGames(summary.partyGames(games))
```

# Monopoly Simulation

Additionally, you can simulate Monopoly games based on the 2008 US version of the game. 

```{r}

library(partyGames)
monopolyGame <- simulateMonopoly()
monopolyGame
summary.monopoly(monopolyGame)
plot.monopoly(monopolyGame)

```

Parallel computing, through OpenMP, is also implemented as demonstrated here:

```{r}
monoParallel <- simulateMonopoly(numGames = 20, 
                                 maxTurns = 500, 
                                 sides    = 6, 
                                 numDice  = 2, 
                                 cores    = 3)

summary.monopoly(monoParallel)
plot.monopoly(monoParallel)
```
