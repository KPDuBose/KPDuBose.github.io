First, due credit where credit is due. The following document was heavily influenced by tutorials found on the [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/).

# Prep Work

First, I recommend making sure you have a current version of [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/), [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/). 

Quarto and RStudio have been created by Posit. Quarto is essentially an updated version of RMarkdown files that have some different capabilites than it's predecessor. I would highly recommend looking ito it. Posit has mad numerous [tutorials](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html) about the framework. It's pretty cool. 

# Getting Started

## Create a New Project

Starting to create a webiste is pretty easy. You simple have to create a new project in RStudio. 

1. Click on the new project button in the top left of the RStudio IDE. 
2. Select new project
3. Select the "Quarto Website" option

![New Project Wizard](website_construction_images/quarto_website_wizard.png)

4. Create a new name for the directory. I host my website on GitHub Pages and follow the naming convention for that (i.e. kpdubose-website which is related to [kpdubose.github.io](kpdubose.github.io))

![Name the Project](website_construction_images/quarto_website_wizard2.png)

5. Then click create project. This will create a new project with four files: _quarto.yml, about.qmd, index.qmd, and styles.css.

## The New Files

Let's dive briefly into the new files you can see. 

### quarto.yml

![_quarto.yml](website_construction_images/quarto_yml.png)

This file is like the yml header that for most .qmd files, but this affects to the whole website. It sets the default theme, default styles, title, navbar, etc... There are a lot of features that can be played with here, [that we can dive into later](https://github.com/KPDuBose/KPDuBose.github.io/blob/master/_quarto.yml), or can be looked up on the Quarto website. 

You can change the theme from page to page (kind of like I did with this page on my website) by specifying a different theme on the individual pages. (Though this is a newer feature. Older versions of Quarto will not allow the themes to differ from page to page.)

### about.qmd

![about.qmd](website_construction_images/about_qmd.png)

This is one of the pages on the website. If you're using this as a portfolio website, this can be the page about you! For the example code of how I set up my "About" page, please look at my [Github file](https://github.com/KPDuBose/KPDuBose.github.io/blob/master/main_about.qmd).

### index.qmd

![index.qmd](website_construction_images/index_qmd.png)

This is the home page for the website. As with the about page, additional information can be added and changed. I have the home page set up to show a list of links to different projects and other pages on the website. Some of these are not accessible via the navbar so it can be pretty helpful. You can even just use this page as your about you page. For an example of you I set up my index page, please [click here](https://github.com/KPDuBose/KPDuBose.github.io/blob/master/index.qmd).

### styles.css

![styles.css](website_construction_images/styles_css.png)

This is the styles.css page. You can assign html objects for the website here.

### Not made, but maybe helpful, a .scss file

This file isn't generated automatically, but it can be helpful to have for changing the theme of your website. 

You can use it to edit the website theme by specifying specific colors, specific fonts, background colors, etc... I edit this as needed, but most of the [Quarto website themes](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html). If you have questions about what a specific theme looks like, they can all be found [here](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/main/scss/_variables.scss).

I copied my theme from the `morph` theme, but then made some changes to the custom.scss associated with it. For an example of this theme, please look [here](https://github.com/KPDuBose/KPDuBose.github.io/blob/master/custom.scss).

## Let's check it out

There are two important terminal commands to know when constructing your website.

The first is `quarto preview`. This is the general, let's make sure everything is linked properly and working the way I was hoping it would. 

![quarto preview](website_construction_images/terminal_quarto_preview.png)

The second command is `quarto render`. This command builds the website. It should be run before you upload the files to the cloud, or if you make any big changes to the themes of the website. 

When you run the `quarto preview` command it should look something like this (assuming you haven't made any changes). 

![Home Page](website_construction_images/example_website_home.png)

![About Page](website_construction_images/example_website_about.png)

But yeah. That's the basics. You can play around with it. The next few sections cover my ramblings and different work arounds that I have found for problems that I have had. These can all be found by searching the internet, but I thought it might be helpful to keep some here. 

# Additional Thoughts and Examples

## Different Quarto Formats

I've started to experiment with a few different formats for pages. I'm planning to keep a running list of formats I've gotten to integrate with the GitHub pages website properly and other tips and tricks for them. 

Renders from a .qmd with no trouble:

- html
- pdf

Everything tells me it should work, but it hasn't yet:

- revealjs

## Hosting on GitHub pages

### The docs folder

If you plan to host on GitHub pages, there are a few tips.

In the _quarto.yml file, include the following:

```
#| code-copy: true
---
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs
---
```


I push my entire project including all of my .qmd files and images I used in making my website, mainly for easy reference in this page of my website. When you `quarto render` it creates a few different files, including the "docs" directory if you have included the `output-dir: docs` option. 

![Folders](website_construction_images/folders_after_render.png)

The "docs" folder contains the fully built website. When you push to GitHub, there is an option to build from a specific branch and folder. Make sure you are building from the docs folder. 

![Pages](website_construction_images/github_docs.png)

### .nojekyll file

If you're hosting on GitHub, you need to include a .nojekyll file. 

You can include one by running the following line of cod in the command terminal

For Windows:

```
copy NUL .nojekyll
```

For Mac/Linux:

```
touch .nojekyll
```

### The final push

In the command terminal, the following lines of code can be run to push to GitHub. This is after you've linked the depository to you project. 

```
quarto render
git add docs
git commit -m "Publish site to docs/"
git push
```

Additionally, you can just render the website and upload the docs folder to the pages website. 

## How to structure a _quarto.yml

Below is the code I have used for my [_quarto.yml](https://github.com/KPDuBose/KPDuBose.github.io/blob/master/_quarto.yml). This has a brief explanation of each code chunk and what it does for the website. 

This section defines the project type, and the output-directory. Since I host my website on GitHub, I have my output-directory set as docs, as explained above. The render option let's you select which documents you would like to render to the website. "*.qmd" tells Quarto to render all .qmd files. "!tournament-announcements/" and "!resumes/" tells Quarto to not render any files found in this directory

```
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs
  render:
    - "*.qmd"
    - "!tournament-announcements/"
    - "!resumes/"
```

The next two section deal with the look of the website. This specific section defines the title of the website as "Kline DuBose" (fitting for a portfolio website) and then establishes the navbar at the top of the page. It sets it to the left and makes then links to pages I have made and set in the navbar. There are a lot of options for this, but googling website options makes it easy for you to look into it.

```
website:
  title: "Kline DuBose"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - href: main_about.qmd
        text: About
      - href: main_projects.qmd
        text: Projects
```

This section sets up the footer for the entire website. Mine includes links with specific icons and different websites. As well as the address of my institution. 

```
  page-footer:
    background: light
    left:
      - icon: twitter-x
        href: https://x.com/KlineDuBose
      - icon: github
        href: https://github.com/KPDuBose
      - icon: linkedin
        href: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kline-dubose/
      - icon: envelope
        href: mailto:kline.dubose@utah.edu
    right:
      - "295 Chipeta Way, 3rd Floor
         Salt Lake City, UT 84108
         United States"
```

This last section sets additional format information for the website. 

```
format:
  html:
    theme: 
      - morph
      - custom.scss
    css: styles.css
    toc: true
```

## Resume

You should be able to include your resume or CV on the website without too much trouble. I have a quarto document that I use to make sure it renders nicely and that I don't make any mistakes with my poor Microsoft Word skills. Just make sure that you include a "*.docx" or 
a "*.pdf" option in the render section of your _quarto.yml file. I haven't played around with it a ton. 

If you would like to see the files I've used to construct my CV, they can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/KPDuBose/KPDuBose.github.io/tree/master). 

## Icons

Finding the icons associated with the quarto projects. They can be found on the [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/projects/websites.html) under the **Nav Options** section, but that just redirects you to the [Bootstrap icons website](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/). Quarto uses the bootstrap framework, I think. I haven't really delved into it, so don't take my word for it. 

## 404

You can also include an error page. Unless you're doing something really fancy, you can just include a 404.qmd file. My [404.qmd](https://github.com/KPDuBose/KPDuBose.github.io/blob/master/404.qmd) is pretty basic, but it fits well with my theme. Here's what it looks like when you find [it](https://kpdubose.github.io/tournament-announcements/dubose-open2025.html).

If you're doing something fancier, check out the [website navigation tutorial](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-navigation.html#pages-404)

## That's it, for now

That should be enough information to help you get started. Quarto is a versatile tool, and they have a lot of tutorials to help one get profecient at using it. 

Feel free to check out my [GitHub project](https://github.com/KPDuBose/KPDuBose.github.io/tree/master) and let me know if you have any question. 

Good luck out there!
